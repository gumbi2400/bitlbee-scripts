Scripts for Bitlbee

This is just some basic scripts I found usefull for BitlBee on Centos 6.4. I noticed that my installation didn't have an init script so I decided I may as well make one on my own! 

At this point, this is just the init script, and a quick script to install. It assumes BitlBee is running in Daemon mode (Though I suppose ForkDaemon would still work).
